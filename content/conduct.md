All attendees, speakers, patrons, and volunteers of _Love Your Enemies_ are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.

### In Brief

Our colloquium is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, parties, Twitter, and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

### Longer Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately expelling the offender from XOXO with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organizers, a member of security, or one of the _Love Your Enemies_ volunteers immediately. All reports will be handled in the strictest confidence.

Staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the festival.
